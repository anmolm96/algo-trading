## Abstract
#### It was hypotheized that Warren Buffet's claim: "Over a ten-year period commencing on January 1, 2008, and ending on December 31, 2017, the S&P 500 will outperform a portfolio of funds of hedge funds, when performance is measured on a basis net of fees, costs and expenses." is incorrect.

#### I will be simulating a portfolio of funds by trading stocks based on their operating margins and revenue growth, and hence by trading a large number of companies the risk per company is reduced. Similarly a fund of hedge funds is an investment into several hedge funds which in turn use several startegies to trade in the market. My basis of using operating margins, revenue growth and both shorting and longing stocks help simulate my portfolio as a hedge fund.

#### By using the quantopian platform, I will be simulating my algorithm between the 1st of January 2008 and 1st of June 2017 to see how I perform against the S&P 500 to see whether I prove or contradict my hypothesis
